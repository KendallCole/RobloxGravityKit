Kit to easily add "Gravity Zones" that you can design levels with. 

I've been working on a game using this system. I figured some other people out there may also want to use it. 


Gravity mechanics are a modified verion of Egomoose's https://github.com/EgoMoose/rbx-wallstick 


## Usage:

For each gravity zone part, you can configure the following attributes:


- "Gravity" - Strength gravity will be on that zone
- "Priority" - Can be useful for overlapping zones. Higher priority zones will be considered first
- "REVERSE" - Whether the gravity for that zone is push or pull
